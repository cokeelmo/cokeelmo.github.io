    <h1>Seminars.</h1>

    <h2>Easi</h2>
    <p>During this seminar, Easi gave an introduction to the possibilities of Microsoft Cloud, focusing on Azure and Intune. The session demonstrated how these tools can be used for cloud management, security, and device management within companies.<br><strong>PXL G410</strong><br><em>March 12, 2024 | 09:00 – 12:00</em></p>

    <h2>Toreon</h2>
    <p>In this seminar, Toreon introduced us to ethical hacking through realistic challenges. Together with experienced penetration testers, we investigated application vulnerabilities and then analyzed the code to find the root causes.<br><strong>PXL G410</strong><br><em>March 19, 2024 | 08:30 – 12:30</em></p>

    <h2>Cegeka</h2>
    <p>Cegeka provided insight into the use of Open Source in IT and the associated risks. They showed how they manage these risks and why a conscious approach to Open Source is crucial for modern software development.<br><strong>PXL G410</strong><br><em>April 23, 2024 | 09:00 – 11:00</em></p>

    <h2>RCCU</h2>
    <p>The RCCU (Regional Computer Crime Unit) gave an inside look into their work within the federal police, focusing on digital forensic investigations and securing digital evidence. They also discussed modern cybercrime challenges such as ransomware, encryption, and the rapid evolution of technology.<br><strong>PXL G414</strong><br><em>May 7, 2024 | 09:00 – 12:00</em></p>

    <h2>IBM</h2>
    <p>This IBM seminar focused on the synergy between Generative AI and Quantum Computing. The session demonstrated how GenAI is used for quantum programming, code generation, and how both technologies lead to more powerful applications and more efficient algorithms.<br><strong>Corda 7 – CC712</strong><br><em>November 6, 2024 | 13:15 – 16:00</em></p>

    <h2>Glou</h2>
    <p>In this DevSecOps workshop, we learned how to safely develop and deploy software in the cloud. Through hands-on labs and tools like Trivy, Gatekeeper, and Nikto, we gained insights into detecting and fixing vulnerabilities before software goes live.<br><strong>Corda 7 – CC713</strong><br><em>November 13, 2024 | 13:30 – 17:30</em></p>

    <h2>Cegeka</h2>
    <p>During this company visit, we first received a presentation about Cegeka and their data center infrastructure. Afterwards, we got to physically enter the data center and view the cooling systems and security measures up close.<br><strong>Cegeka – Hasselt</strong><br><em>November 20, 2024 | 14:15 – 16:15</em></p>

    <h2>Police</h2>
    <p>In this forensics workshop by the police, we learned how to conduct forensic investigations in Linux using Sleuthkit command line tools. We made forensic copies, recovered deleted files, and eventually solved an entire digital case without the use of automated tools.<br><strong>Corda 7 – CC714</strong><br><em>December 4, 2024 | 13:30 – 17:00</em></p>
