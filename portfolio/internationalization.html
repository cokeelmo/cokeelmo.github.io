      <h1>Internationalization.</h1>
      <h2>Linz - Austria</h2>
      <p>As part of my internationalization experience, 
        I went on a five-day trip to Linz, Austria. 
        After a long and slightly painful bus ride, 
        we finally arrived at our hotel, Sommerhaus, 
        located in a student neighborhood outside the 
        city. The area had affordable food spots and easy 
        tram access to the center, which made exploring Linz
         quite simple. It was a good base to get a taste of Austrian student life 
         and culture.
      </p>
      <h2>Ars Electronica</h2>
      <p>We visited the Ars Electronica Center, one of the most interesting
        stops of the trip. It’s a futuristic museum about technology, art,
        and society. We got a guided tour and saw a lot of impressive stuff — 
        from the evolution of music, to a system that predicts the impact of
        things like rising migration on different parts of society.
        There were also demonstrations of 3D scanning and printing, 
        even in flexible metals. At the end, we reflected on the full
        lifecycle of electronics — from natural resources to devices,
        and what happens when they’re discarded.
      </p>
      <h2>Hagenberg Campus</h2>
      <p>We went to the Hagenberg campus of the University 
        of Applied Sciences Upper Austria (FH OÖ). It was cool 
        to see how international the place was — over 1,200 students
        from around the world. The campus was modern and well-equipped,
        and we got to see how they use up-to-date technology in their education.
        The visit gave me a good impression of how studying abroad might
        look and the kind of environment you can end up in.</p>
      <h2>Salzburg</h2>
      <p>On the last full day, we took a trip to Salzburg, 
        with a quick stop in Gmunden first. The view over Traunsee 
        lake in Gmunden was amazing — straight out of a travel brochure. 
        </p>

        Salzburg itself was a nice change of pace: beautiful streets, chill 
        atmosphere, and a bit of time to enjoy the city and just take it all in. 
        A good way to wrap up the trip before heading back home.</p>
